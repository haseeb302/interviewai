    {
      "question": "Can you describe your experience with Vue 3, TypeScript, and SASS?",
      "answer": "I have extensive experience working with Vue 3, TypeScript, and SASS. In my last project, I developed a highly interactive user interface using Vue 3, making use of TypeScript for type safety and scalability. I also utilized SASS for more efficient and maintainable styling. This combination allowed me to create a robust frontend platform that was both performant and easy to maintain."
    },
    {
      "question": "How have you handled collaboration with back-end developers and designers?",
      "answer": "Collaboration is key in any development process. In my previous role, I worked closely with back-end developers to ensure seamless integration between the front-end and back-end systems. I also collaborated with designers to transform design prototypes into functional user interfaces. This often involved regular meetings and using tools like Jira and Slack to keep everyone on the same page."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you provide an example of when you had to create wireframes and prototypes for a new feature?",
      "answer": "In my role at LastingSales, I was tasked with developing a new CRM feature. I started by creating wireframes using Figma to outline the basic structure of the UI. After getting approval, I moved on to develop detailed prototypes. These prototypes were then reviewed by stakeholders, adjusted based on feedback, and eventually used for the final implementation."
    },
    {
      "question": "What approaches do you use to ensure that user interfaces are intuitive and user-friendly?",
      "answer": "I focus on simplicity and clarity in design to ensure user interfaces are intuitive and user-friendly. I often use user testing and feedback sessions to understand how real users interact with the UI. Additionally, I make use of design systems to maintain consistency across the application, ensuring a cohesive user experience."
    },
    {
      "question": "Describe a challenging problem you solved in a previous front-end development project.",
      "answer": "One challenging problem I faced was during the migration from AngularJS to React.js at LastingSales. The old codebase had a lot of technical debt and performance issues. I broke down the migration into smaller, manageable tasks and set up automated tests to ensure that the migration didn’t break any existing functionality. This approach not only improved performance but also enhanced user satisfaction significantly."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you stay updated with the latest trends and best practices in front-end development?",
      "answer": "I actively follow industry blogs, participate in online communities such as Stack Overflow and GitHub, and attend webinars and conferences. Additionally, I regularly experiment with new technologies in personal projects to stay hands-on with the latest trends and best practices."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is your experience with version control systems like Git?",
      "answer": "I use Git daily for version control. At both CreditBook and LastingSales, I was responsible for managing repositories, creating branches for features, and collaborating with other developers through pull requests and code reviews. This ensured that our codebase remained clean and manageable."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you explain a situation where you had to work under tight deadlines? How did you manage it?",
      "answer": "During the pre-series A round at CreditBook, we had a tight deadline to launch a major update. I prioritized tasks, delegated effectively within my team, and worked extra hours when necessary. We also held daily stand-up meetings to track progress and address any blockers immediately. This ensured we met our deadline without compromising on quality."
    },
    {
      "question": "What techniques do you use to optimize the performance of front-end applications?",
      "answer": "I focus on code splitting, lazy loading, and optimizing assets. For instance, at LastingSales, I used React’s lazy loading feature to defer the loading of non-essential components, which significantly improved the load time. I also minified CSS and JavaScript files and implemented caching strategies to improve performance."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why do you want to work at The Virtual Recruiter, and how do you see yourself fitting into our team?",
